hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra features and commands that make working with GitHub easier.

``` bash
$ hub clone rtomayko/tilt

# expands to:
$ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/tilt.git
```

hub is best aliased as `git`, so you can type `$ git &lt;command&gt;` in the shell and get all the usual `hub` features.
